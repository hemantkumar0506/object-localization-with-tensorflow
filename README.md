# Object Localization with TensorFlow

Plot bounding boxes, using data generator, create custom metric & custom callbacks to predict class and bounding box together using openemoji dataset.


## Technical Aspects

- Create synthesis data
- plot bounding boxes over images
- Create custom metric 
- Create custom callbacks
- predict class & bounding box together


## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.4. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) here. 

```bash
  !pip install tensorflow==2.4
  

```
